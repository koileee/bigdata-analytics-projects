The numbering of the ultrasound sensors starts at the front of the robot and increases in clockwise direction. To make our data streaming scenario realistic, we have developed a server that streams the robot's data to your program (as if you are really getting the data live from the robot). You will use Spark Streaming to perform a few simple tasks on this data.\n",
