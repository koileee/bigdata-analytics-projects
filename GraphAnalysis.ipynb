    "Spark provides the ability to *cache* RDDs.   This is useful when an RDD will be used more than once.   Instead of computing the same RDD multiple times, it can be computed once, cached, and then re-used from the cache.   Read about caching in the Spark textbook, or in the [persistence section of the Spark RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#rdd-persistence).   Caching can be particularly effective for iterative Spark applications, like those you are writing for this assignment.\n",

It should only affect performance.)   Don't worry about different persistence levels.   Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n",

I had to call upon the adjacency_matrix  in every iteration for mapping each node in the adjacency list with a probability, so by caching it I could reduce recreating it in every loop.
